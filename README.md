_Your goal is to create a personal finance tracker software._

_Users can register to your web application. After registering, they are able to easily add their monthly expenses with their respective categories, such as "Gasoline for car, category: Car", or "Rent, category: Living"._

_You can design the data structure as you wish._

_From this data, you should create a data visualization chart or grid, using a JS -library and also calculate days until the next payday (or end of given period), daily expense rate, potential savings per month, which can also be done by setting personal saving goal and giving rough estimate budget of daily expense maximum for the goals to be met._
